# Mandelbrot Set Explorer
##### This program was created as part of a school assignment on the topic "Calculation and representation of the Mandelbrot set"
The mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers $c$ for which the function $f_c(z)=z^2+c$ does not diverge to infinity when iterated from $z=0$. This is a program that visualizes the Mandelbrot set. It allows the user to zoom into the set, change the coloring and save images of the set, among other things. 

This application runs on java 11.0.6.
